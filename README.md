# Spoozer

Looks for what are you listening on spotify and download flac file of it from deezer if you have listened it more than N times.  

ToDo:  
-Error Handling  
-Change name after download  
-Make spoo.py and zer.py runing from one app   
-Save listening time and song time to database for further data analysis
